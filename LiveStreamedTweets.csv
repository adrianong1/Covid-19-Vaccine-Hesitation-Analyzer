@capettinicchio @Angelasfreenews I know five that have passed from complications from the vaccine including my father I know 20 who walked off covid natural immunity
"208,000 health service workers are choosing natural immunity over the covid vaccine. There's something to clap üëè üôå   https://t.co/qO9cvnvBtH  #Covid #COVID19 #CovidVaccine https://t.co/WY7UUgqmaa"
"@adventuredecor @Kalelidjit @dahollister @stephiebieRN @fordnation @celliottability Which part of that is nonsense.  Catching Covid gives you the best immunity, but also a risk of death.  The vaccine reduces the risk of death if you then do catch Covid, after which your body can still build up the natural immunity."
"No I‚Äôm not calling the new variant omicron anymore, I will only be referring to it as ‚ÄúMILD COVID‚Äù, as it appears to be uhhh mild, even if people with immunity (natural or vaccine acquired) can still catch it."
"This was the icing on the cake. This REPUBLICAN led state showing proof in multiple studies that the Covid vaccine is both SAFE and wAY MORE effective than natural immunity. If that isn't enough, what is? They just choose not to trust science cuz ""libs do"" https://t.co/1q0Yyqm36i"

@worldsfirstblep Yes. And studies show that you are better protected with the vaccine even if you've already had COVID.
@nemesis12345671 @TeslaAviation Yes obviously. Vaccines are good and will help a lot of people survive it who maybe immunocompromised. But forcing the vaccine on children and really anyone under 40 is madness. Also people who have had covid already have immunity way WAY better than what the shot can give

ok but im kinda mad like..  how are you gonna tell me to wait with the vaccine til other people have gotten it bc I already had covid but then when I'm able to take the first dose they start with vaccine passes so I'm not allowed to do anything until I've gotten the 2nd dose...
"@Jamin2g Many have already had covid, so have immunity. The government is trying to force people to have a vaccine they don't need."
"@rinoathf @hurshidn @BradHuston Because if you had Covid already, you are compounding additional risk in getting the vaccine."
@BrianAn20031587 @Clairejones_444 Quoting stats with no evidence. Does a healthy 30 year old who‚Äôs had covid twice with no real issue need a vaccine? For me it‚Äôs madness to make people have a jab for something their body can already deal with
"@4given9 @joshindahl @50countries @annbauerwriter Depending on your age, does this mean we should all be running out to get the Varicella vaccine?? I mean, I had chicken pox as a kid, just like I already had Covid and recovered."
My sister has Covid and she says it‚Äôs no worse than the flu she got it from one of her kids and his symptoms are already gone and I was around them when he had it and I have no symptoms so tell me again why i need the vaccine.
@griffin98103616 @jakeesreality Not just Leukemia all types of cancer have increased. It has especially gotten worse for patients who already had cancer previous to the vax. Just do a little research. It's not hard to find. I'll give you 1 example. https://t.co/eyRSPCIg51
@IronhaloXRP @PennyBritish Covid is an IQ test many have already failed. imagine if Covid were like Ebola and people had to bleed from the eyes and have their internal organs liquified to convince everyone else it was real. good thing this is the first disease in history that requires a vaccine.
@Hotdynamixxx @micahschwartzz @Amazingx @GarrettCrowson Also you can‚Äôt give people hep B if you‚Äôve already had the vaccine :) you can effectively be treated and ‚Äúcured ‚Äú with COVID that‚Äôs not how that works at all . You can still transfer the virus and transit it after the vaccine .
"@ThatBackus @ZubyMusic If you had not already had COVID, I would agree with you. The complicating factor of potential lingering effects made active by a sudden increase in anti-bodies makes it far less likely to have been a direct result of the vaccine acting alone; more likely a combination with COVID"

"@yammerapple @Josethrac @c_tiot Oh and that is where you‚Äôre wrong. For people who have already had Covid, they do in fact know what the risk of having Covid is.

The CDC looked into 8 thousand that were said to have died from the vaccine. They found they died because of preexisting conditions or taking the vaccine after they already had Covid. They have not proved anyone died from the vaccine. https://t.co/SMzA5W5B44
"@plextonic @profgalloway ... are less likely to pass the virus to their close contacts if they have already had a COVID-19 vaccine than if they haven‚Äôt. But that protective effect is relatively small, and dwindles alarmingly at three months after the receipt of the second shot. https://t.co/dLUk5BIYAw"
Do I still need the vaccine if I‚Äôve already had COVID?
"@King_DREAMER @trouble_man90 @Simpevision @coolj1201 @Lj_Foster Not true. I've already had Covid. I have a 1% chance of hospitalization or death that I've already beaten. Taking the vaccine gives me 100% exposure to any potential adverse effects, for which I've been told I am a candidate (blood clots/myocarditis). Why would I risk 1% vs 100%?"
@Barbs_Opinions @greg_travis @tomdog @BKopernikus There is a reason this was called COVID 19. The virus has been studied for 20 years. The technology for the vaccine has also been studied for 20 years. They simply utilized what they already had and ran clinical trials.
"@King_DREAMER @trouble_man90 @Simpevision @coolj1201 @Lj_Foster Yeah so this article addresses natural immunity from the perspective of a person who has NOT had Covid. As in taking chances with a mild case vs vaccine. It does not address a person like myself that already has recovered and has antibodies, like I said.....try again? ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"@DexterTempest @SkyNews I've already had covid &amp; recovered , didn't need a vaccine or boosters as my immune system is healthy ...pumping my body full of unproven experimental vaccines circumvents my immune system ....I'd suggest you your own research ...good day üôÇ"
@Ginger6113 @BBCBreaking Well actually yes they do. Most people seen in the ER with covid in my area already had the vaccine.  Depending on co morbidly some still end up on vents. I always get the question....but I got the vaccine.....sorry it doesn't stop you from getting or spreading

@people_wee @che_eliseo @BallouxFrancois No they didn't. It was designed for limited application for the at risk group prevents serious illness and deaths. That's was the health crisis at hand. Which these prophylactic vaccines do very well. COVID is a zooatopic virus to. So human stralizing vaccine would not work.

Come on @sajidjavid @grantshapps families need their children‚Äôs COVID passes to prove immunity or vaccine status. Many countries in Europe need this to enter for over 12s and even to access domestic venues. There is absolutely no reason as to why we don‚Äôt give this to under 16s https://t.co/N49262ozOT

@AmandaPritchard so @grantshapps has announced covid vaccine passports are here to stay for travel. I guess you‚Äôve sorted access for under 16‚Äôs now so they are no longer discriminated against when it comes to travel

Yes getting vaccinated is the single most useful and best way you can protect yourself from Covid-19. But pretending like the vaccine alone was going to allow us to ‚Äúgo back to normal life‚Äù and ditch all other precautions was always misguided and dangerous.

"Like @potus and @KamalaHarris , I was initially afraid to get the vaccine because it was developed under the #antiscience regime of DJT.

@Rallybum1 @GostincarRok @ProKlausSchwab @Amabiel1 I‚Äôm just saying that you need to compare like with like. If covid is less dangerous for most people and tbe vaccine is less dangerous too then the risk/benefit equation still favours vaccination.

"VA Lt. Gov.-elect Winsome Sears claims that vaccine mandates should not apply to persons who have already been infected with COVID-19. But according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, she is wrong. https://t.co/qbIBCjrSd7 via @factcheckdotorg"
@abigbutandsmile @andy_utoronto @Gab_H_R @FanCpixie Not much different to what was already happening. Most of us vaxxed or not will get infected at least once at some point. Some will even develop Covid symptoms more than once. This will occur until a good vaccine is developed (ü§ûüèªfor codagenix). Otherwise therapeutics are the key.
"If Cuba could create a safe and effective vaccine for COVID, that would be incredible! If it comes to be, I‚Äôd take it except I already have a natural immunity from being infected.  https://t.co/5HceYEI0om"
@doccandidate @Rob162816 @DrTomFrieden Vaccinated can also carry and be infected again. Majority are already vaccinated: https://t.co/XuAS5NEnnn
"@CallieLu5 @mistyloll @MomentoX1 @YardleyShooting Again, studies show that they do prevent a lot of infections from happening in the first place, and if it was a treatment not a vaccine, you could give it once someone was already infected, but you can‚Äôt.  https://t.co/67d3i8Gqnw   https://t.co/kfb7NQ6Ycm  https://t.co/TpaPzp9mpo"
@StrategicDial0g @inquisitiveleft @MaxBlumenthal @mehdirhasan As a Brit I made the personal decision not to have the Covid vaccine after already being infected and watching someone close to me suffer heart damage after the first AZ shot. I have to say that among English friends there's is an acceptance of bodily autonomy.
@dumiez77 @mentoor_peter @MoshabelaMosa My best guess is to punish Africa for low vax numbers which appear to show that the least vaxed countries have the least infected and the least deaths...   Omicron was detected in fully vaxed people and is already in the UK and very many other countries https://t.co/vjy6iWcqLs

@WillGrindecobbe @tc2582 @Zd_prime @lukhanyombilin As far as I understand it the vaccines were developed for Covid prior mutation. We don't know yet but the vaccine may not provide the same level of protection against the new variant. Also there could be thousands of people already infected.
@Wisco The fact that we have variants developing in vaccinated proves the mRNA vaccine isn't as effective as you believe.  It's already been proven that vaccinated people can get infected by Covid-19 (SARS-COVID-2) and can still transmit the virus. Which allows virus mutation.
"@drjackUK I‚Äôve already Covid, and based on studies I only have a 0.4% chance of reinfection and a 0.1% chance of severe disease if I am infected. I‚Äôll take those chances over the vaccine!"
"@SkyNews These updates are going to become very tedious, very quickly. Chances are there are substantially more people infected than we already know about. Hope we don‚Äôt get a Tweet every time.  With the passage of time, important to understand disease severity, vaccine status etc."
"Even if you are already vaccinated, you still have to follow safety protocols because others are unvaccinated yet and you can still possibly get infected with COVID-19 depending on the efficiency of the chosen vaccine."
@basedalert @ska_ves @SenSanders Not a vaccine given it does not prevent infection.  *All* can be infected &amp; transmit equally.  Thus if vaxed sniffles might be Covid.   Why didn‚Äôt they tweak for Delta when it was in UK &amp; before it fully set in the southern states first?  Suddenly Moderna already has a new one.
"@Lewisdpi It‚Äôs not that huge, and it also depends on whether or not you‚Äôve already been infected. Most of the current crop of vaccine efficacy results are based on those who have never previously caught Covid. Scientists have remained predictably silent on the former."
@Woody_az @davechensky @TeachingAgent have you looked at like any graph anywhere. the vaccine did fucking stop it. the reason covid didn't disappear is because there were already ten million dumbasses infected.
"@thetweetbull @KimmoTorikka @AnnaGDoktor @stor Jaha, √§r det cherrypicking du vill h√•lla p√• med s√• vars√•god:  ‚ÄùThe study shows that people who become infected with the Delta variant are less likely to pass the virus to their close contacts if they have already had a COVID-19 vaccine than if they haven‚Äôt.‚Äù"
"@ChristineGarst3 @DuncanBannatyne This result does not guarantee you are fully immune (protected) from COVID-19. It's still possible to get the virus again or spread it, although your risk is reduced if you've had the vaccine or already been infected."
@UnSubtleDesi Also publish an article on how immunity acquired from covid infection is better from vaccine acquired infection and where people who have infected and recovered may not need vaccine as they have better immunity already
"@thewatts357 @Lorraine0164 If Covid is so dangerous, why doesn‚Äôt the government issue every illegal crossing the border a vaccine that they have mandated we take ? My family has had Covid already so we will not be taking any vaccine, we got infected by a vaccinated person as well."
"@HeathBishop13 @tbblount @kennann49 @richie_tri @JoeConchaTV The study shows that people infected by Delta variant are less likely to pass the virus if they have already had a COVID-19 vaccine than if they haven‚Äôt1.

@NewDay Since we can't tell yet how many children already have natural immunity we can't make this comparison.  They are comparing the chances of side effects from the vaccine against the chances of side effects from covid of a child who already got infected.

@KonstantinKisin Hello from France. I‚Äôm speechless. And angry. The government just announced that those already infected who received a dose of vaccine will have to receive the 2d dose in January. This is horrible and unscientific (science tell us that having covid plus one dose is best).

@pdzur1 Go for what?  Getting a vaccine? I already said I wouldn't take a mRNA Covid Vaccine due to the dangerous side effects and for such a low risk. Even with the gov't numbers the survival rate is over 98%!  Now if there was a safe and effective vaccine I would think about taking it.

@Ubiquitous_Romp @st3venwilliams @HugoGye @theipaper @poppyeh None of this is true. 8.6 billion doses of vaccine have been given. We know for certain that side effects are extremely rare and much less dangerous than covid.

@Trsnowball @hahahaherewegoo @TashaMarie206 @Telegraph Calling people who refuse to get this particular vaccine antivaxxers is absurd. I am fully vaccinated. I refuse to take this current one because as a 30 year old male I am more likely to get dangerous side effects from it than I am to die from covid. It‚Äôs pretty simple.

"@HANCOCK_XDXD same, had covid twice already tho, im going for 3x covid 3x vaccine for sigma male ascension"
@worldsfirstblep Yes. And studies show that you are better protected with the vaccine even if you've already had COVID.
@nemesis12345671 @TeslaAviation Yes obviously. Vaccines are good and will help a lot of people survive it who maybe immunocompromised. But forcing the vaccine on children and really anyone under 40 is madness. Also people who have had covid already have immunity way WAY better than what the shot can give

ok but im kinda mad like..  how are you gonna tell me to wait with the vaccine til other people have gotten it bc I already had covid but then when I'm able to take the first dose they start with vaccine passes so I'm not allowed to do anything until I've gotten the 2nd dose...
"@Jamin2g Many have already had covid, so have immunity. The government is trying to force people to have a vaccine they don't need."
"@rinoathf @hurshidn @BradHuston Because if you had Covid already, you are compounding additional risk in getting the vaccine."
@BrianAn20031587 @Clairejones_444 Quoting stats with no evidence. Does a healthy 30 year old who‚Äôs had covid twice with no real issue need a vaccine? For me it‚Äôs madness to make people have a jab for something their body can already deal with
"@4given9 @joshindahl @50countries @annbauerwriter Depending on your age, does this mean we should all be running out to get the Varicella vaccine?? I mean, I had chicken pox as a kid, just like I already had Covid and recovered."
My sister has Covid and she says it‚Äôs no worse than the flu she got it from one of her kids and his symptoms are already gone and I was around them when he had it and I have no symptoms so tell me again why i need the vaccine.
@griffin98103616 @jakeesreality Not just Leukemia all types of cancer have increased. It has especially gotten worse for patients who already had cancer previous to the vax. Just do a little research. It's not hard to find. I'll give you 1 example. https://t.co/eyRSPCIg51
@IronhaloXRP @PennyBritish Covid is an IQ test many have already failed. imagine if Covid were like Ebola and people had to bleed from the eyes and have their internal organs liquified to convince everyone else it was real. good thing this is the first disease in history that requires a vaccine.
@Hotdynamixxx @micahschwartzz @Amazingx @GarrettCrowson Also you can‚Äôt give people hep B if you‚Äôve already had the vaccine :) you can effectively be treated and ‚Äúcured ‚Äú with COVID that‚Äôs not how that works at all . You can still transfer the virus and transit it after the vaccine .
"@ThatBackus @ZubyMusic If you had not already had COVID, I would agree with you. The complicating factor of potential lingering effects made active by a sudden increase in anti-bodies makes it far less likely to have been a direct result of the vaccine acting alone; more likely a combination with COVID"
CDC refuse to look at Natural Immunity as a way out.  The idiots are clearly blocking the data from coming out. You DO NOT need a vaccine if you have had COVID already. https://t.co/EQMMS0Lm9f

Not hard."
"@eIfcup I already had covid and loved, and had cousins who had problems up to and including death immediately following the vaccine."

"This isn't jaw dropping news. This is more of a reminder of things we already knew. If you've been infected with COVID already, please get your vaccine. You will have super antibodies. If you don't, you run the risk of yet another infection with potentially devastating effects. https://t.co/171wgZt5Px"
@RobOHanrahan What happens now with vaccine for all the 5 to 12 year olds who have already been infected with covid. Do they have to wait 6 months for a vaccine and how will they know for sure how many children were asymptomatic before giving the vaccine.
"Yes, the vaccine reduces one‚Äôs chances of being infected, but the man behind the curtain is that the odds of getting Covid are already much lower than media and government would have you believe."

"@CNN By the time they know. Possibly above 50% would have been infected already. By the time the vaccine (if new one is necessary) is rolled out. Variant ""Sigma""(I suspect that's the next one) would have been discovered. So... It seems Covid is running faster than us."
@TrumpDownfall @oldnormalmatt @VaxxAll @WestwoodParking @chrissaccoccia1 Our chances for majority were already slim if infected by COVID to be hospitalized or die before the vaccine. Nothing‚Äôs changed.

"@Mur1thi @Mr_Guantai @MissNerima You probably don't need it immediately after the infection, but doctors recommend getting it even if you have been infected because it strengthens your immunity. See e.g. here: https://t.co/zLvAaqV1ft"
@ResisterSis1 Quarantine for those infected. Rapid tests for close contacts. No variant escapes the vaccine. We already know that about Omicron re: severity. And the preliminary data shows they are still effective against symptomatic covid. https://t.co/8jT2tkaMO4
@KirkwoodDW @itslivvvvxo @tarnsog @gilsyb @VoortMartijn @Sacha_Lord So what your saying is people who have been infected by covid and recovered should now take a vaccine that wanes after 3 months meaning you‚Äôll need 3+ a year to protect other people who have already had the vaccine and want more protection? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Come on now.
"VA Lt. Gov.-elect Winsome Sears claims that vaccine mandates should not apply to persons who have already been infected with COVID-19. But according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, she is wrong. https://t.co/qbIBCjrSd7 via @factcheckdotorg"
@abigbutandsmile @andy_utoronto @Gab_H_R @FanCpixie Not much different to what was already happening. Most of us vaxxed or not will get infected at least once at some point. Some will even develop Covid symptoms more than once. This will occur until a good vaccine is developed (ü§ûüèªfor codagenix). Otherwise therapeutics are the key.

@WillGrindecobbe @tc2582 @Zd_prime @lukhanyombilin As far as I understand it the vaccines were developed for Covid prior mutation. We don't know yet but the vaccine may not provide the same level of protection against the new variant. Also there could be thousands of people already infected.
@Wisco The fact that we have variants developing in vaccinated proves the mRNA vaccine isn't as effective as you believe.  It's already been proven that vaccinated people can get infected by Covid-19 (SARS-COVID-2) and can still transmit the virus. Which allows virus mutation.
"@drjackUK I‚Äôve already Covid, and based on studies I only have a 0.4% chance of reinfection and a 0.1% chance of severe disease if I am infected. I‚Äôll take those chances over the vaccine!"
"@SkyNews These updates are going to become very tedious, very quickly. Chances are there are substantially more people infected than we already know about. Hope we don‚Äôt get a Tweet every time.  With the passage of time, important to understand disease severity, vaccine status etc."
"Even if you are already vaccinated, you still have to follow safety protocols because others are unvaccinated yet and you can still possibly get infected with COVID-19 depending on the efficiency of the chosen vaccine."
@basedalert @ska_ves @SenSanders Not a vaccine given it does not prevent infection.  *All* can be infected &amp; transmit equally.  Thus if vaxed sniffles might be Covid.   Why didn‚Äôt they tweak for Delta when it was in UK &amp; before it fully set in the southern states first?  Suddenly Moderna already has a new one.
"@Lewisdpi It‚Äôs not that huge, and it also depends on whether or not you‚Äôve already been infected. Most of the current crop of vaccine efficacy results are based on those who have never previously caught Covid. Scientists have remained predictably silent on the former."
@Woody_az @davechensky @TeachingAgent have you looked at like any graph anywhere. the vaccine did fucking stop it. the reason covid didn't disappear is because there were already ten million dumbasses infected.
"@thetweetbull @KimmoTorikka @AnnaGDoktor @stor Jaha, √§r det cherrypicking du vill h√•lla p√• med s√• vars√•god:  ‚ÄùThe study shows that people who become infected with the Delta variant are less likely to pass the virus to their close contacts if they have already had a COVID-19 vaccine than if they haven‚Äôt.‚Äù"
"@ChristineGarst3 @DuncanBannatyne This result does not guarantee you are fully immune (protected) from COVID-19. It's still possible to get the virus again or spread it, although your risk is reduced if you've had the vaccine or already been infected."
@UnSubtleDesi Also publish an article on how immunity acquired from covid infection is better from vaccine acquired infection and where people who have infected and recovered may not need vaccine as they have better immunity already
"@thewatts357 @Lorraine0164 If Covid is so dangerous, why doesn‚Äôt the government issue every illegal crossing the border a vaccine that they have mandated we take ? My family has had Covid already so we will not be taking any vaccine, we got infected by a vaccinated person as well."

@NewDay Since we can't tell yet how many children already have natural immunity we can't make this comparison.  They are comparing the chances of side effects from the vaccine against the chances of side effects from covid of a child who already got infected.

@NidaKirmani It's not anti-science to weigh up the risk of getting Covid and then going on to get seriously ill from it vs the risks of the vaccine especially for young males.   The cost to others is unproven given covid is endemic and vaccinated pass it on too. 1/2

"@DrMoragKerr @Gurdur I don't think patriotism had that much impact on which vaccines we used. We ordered as much Valneva as AZ (https://t.co/x86xxZYoMX)  I'm no expert on this, but at a guess I'd say we ordered less mRNA because it was a new unproven technology. Then we delivered the vaccines we had."

"@EternalPolk @CSJannise @RealSkipBayless @undisputed If you've had covid and have natural antibodies, why would you get a lab made vaccine? Why aren't they talking about therapeutics, natural and heard immunity? Rogers is. It makes no sense unless you're heavily invested in pharmaceutical companies and their advertising dollars."

@normonics @interpretantion That is the way natural immunity  seems to work after you contract Covid... I  have not seen anyone claim that the vaccines now out there worldwide do that.  Maybe a sterile live attenuated vaccine would work that way.  But that's a ways off.
"Question i ask myself is: I've had Covid, i'm told in some regards that having it is better than having a vaccine. But my natural immunity wears off after a certain time. Also that it's good to have a vaccine but that wears off over time &amp; doesn't stop the spread. So what gives?"
There are studies that show that natural immunity outweighs vaccine immunity but the media refuses to share these facts from the¬†New England Journal of Medicine¬†or the success of Gov. Ron DeSantis's policies in Florida which leads the way in COVID safety as of now.

@Dempz8 Medical warfare is being waged against us. I‚Äôm fully aware that covid is serious and dangerous but I‚Äôm also aware that the vaccine has massive risks. When the pro vaxers become more open to this then we have hope but burying head in sand because you are too stubborn is madness.
"@Problematictv @Faye44506836 @4_rabian @Telegraph They don't know the deaths were due to contaminated vaccine, but let's say they were. 500,000 people received the vaccine. Given the statistics quoted above, Covid is still way more dangerous. And you'll still take other medicines despite the risk of accidents, right?"
"finally, the overall point of the article is that vaccine mandates ‚Äúcould‚Äù lead to terminations which ‚Äúcould‚Äù lead to a net loss in patient safety. this doesn‚Äôt address that unvaccinated staff working with COVID patients are themselves dangerous to other patients"

@JonathanPieNews My worry is what vaccinations could get forced on us. Right now most of us take a balanced risk since evidence shows vaccine plus covid seems safer than covid without. But no guarantee it will always be so. AZ was arguably more dangerous for some than covid for example.

Omicron was detected in fully vaxed people and is already in the UK and very many other countries https://t.co/vjy6iWcqLs

@WillGrindecobbe @tc2582 @Zd_prime @lukhanyombilin As far as I understand it the vaccines were developed for Covid prior mutation. We don't know yet but the vaccine may not provide the same level of protection against the new variant. Also there could be thousands of people already infected.
@Wisco The fact that we have variants developing in vaccinated proves the mRNA vaccine isn't as effective as you believe.  It's already been proven that vaccinated people can get infected by Covid-19 (SARS-COVID-2) and can still transmit the virus. Which allows virus mutation.
"@drjackUK I‚Äôve already Covid, and based on studies I only have a 0.4% chance of reinfection and a 0.1% chance of severe disease if I am infected. I‚Äôll take those chances over the vaccine!"
"@SkyNews These updates are going to become very tedious, very quickly. Chances are there are substantially more people infected than we already know about. Hope we don‚Äôt get a Tweet every time.  With the passage of time, important to understand disease severity, vaccine status etc."
"Even if you are already vaccinated, you still have to follow safety protocols because others are unvaccinated yet and you can still possibly get infected with COVID-19 depending on the efficiency of the chosen vaccine."
@basedalert @ska_ves @SenSanders Not a vaccine given it does not prevent infection.  *All* can be infected &amp; transmit equally.  Thus if vaxed sniffles might be Covid.   Why didn‚Äôt they tweak for Delta when it was in UK &amp; before it fully set in the southern states first?  Suddenly Moderna already has a new one.
"@Lewisdpi It‚Äôs not that huge, and it also depends on whether or not you‚Äôve already been infected. Most of the current crop of vaccine efficacy results are based on those who have never previously caught Covid. Scientists have remained predictably silent on the former."
@Woody_az @davechensky @TeachingAgent have you looked at like any graph anywhere. the vaccine did fucking stop it. the reason covid didn't disappear is because there were already ten million dumbasses infected.
"@thetweetbull @KimmoTorikka @AnnaGDoktor @stor Jaha, √§r det cherrypicking du vill h√•lla p√• med s√• vars√•god:  ‚ÄùThe study shows that people who become infected with the Delta variant are less likely to pass the virus to their close contacts if they have already had a COVID-19 vaccine than if they haven‚Äôt.‚Äù"
"@ChristineGarst3 @DuncanBannatyne This result does not guarantee you are fully immune (protected) from COVID-19. It's still possible to get the virus again or spread it, although your risk is reduced if you've had the vaccine or already been infected."
@UnSubtleDesi Also publish an article on how immunity acquired from covid infection is better from vaccine acquired infection and where people who have infected and recovered may not need vaccine as they have better immunity already
"@thewatts357 @Lorraine0164 If Covid is so dangerous, why doesn‚Äôt the government issue every illegal crossing the border a vaccine that they have mandated we take ? My family has had Covid already so we will not be taking any vaccine, we got infected by a vaccinated person as well."
"@HeathBishop13 @tbblount @kennann49 @richie_tri @JoeConchaTV The study shows that people infected by Delta variant are less likely to pass the virus if they have already had a COVID-19 vaccine than if they haven‚Äôt1. But that protective effect is relatively small, and dwindles alarmingly at 3 months https://t.co/b40Xm6rSx0"

@NewDay Since we can't tell yet how many children already have natural immunity we can't make this comparison.  They are comparing the chances of side effects from the vaccine against the chances of side effects from covid of a child who already got infected.

"@airfemale4 I'm respecting your opinion but I'd ask you to please stop spreading scientifically unproven narratives like this. And if you insist, please share your sources so we can fact-check. A lot of women have irregular periods. It has no causal relationship to the COVID vaccine."

Subpoenaed FDA Files Prove Dangerous Side Effects from Pfizer COVID Vaccine https://t.co/8i7KqVxHlC
@pdzur1 Go for what?  Getting a vaccine? I already said I wouldn't take a mRNA Covid Vaccine due to the dangerous side effects and for such a low risk. Even with the gov't numbers the survival rate is over 98%!  Now if there was a safe and effective vaccine I would think about taking it.

"Very Interesting ! Testing on Animals FIRST, until find the accurate cure ! But COVID is tested on HUMANS ! As an Experimental vaccine ! That Does Not Cure ANY !

@Ubiquitous_Romp @st3venwilliams @HugoGye @theipaper @poppyeh None of this is true. 8.6 billion doses of vaccine have been given. We know for certain that side effects are extremely rare and much less dangerous than covid.

@Trsnowball @hahahaherewegoo @TashaMarie206 @Telegraph Calling people who refuse to get this particular vaccine antivaxxers is absurd. I am fully vaccinated. I refuse to take this current one because as a 30 year old male I am more likely to get dangerous side effects from it than I am to die from covid. It‚Äôs pretty simple.

Talking about 'wappies' or 'antivaxers' is disrespectful and not correct. Not taking the Covid-vaccine is not a refusal. Besides that there are unvaccinated people who have full natural immunity and also who are not allowed a vaccine. Rather speak of protected and not protected.

COVID Update: The anti-vaccine natural herd immunity-just go get COVID crowd has met their match ‚Ä¶ with reality. 1/
@FatEmperor @cjsnowdon Getting a vaccine is a health choice. Being morbidly obese is a health choice. Contracting HIV from sex or drugs is a health choice. Type2 diabetes is a health choice. Smoking is a health choice. All lead to worse c19 outcomes. Only 1 is being punished with a covid cert. Discuss

@sajidjavid Theres no justification for ineffective + divisive vaccine passports. All international evidence shows vaccinated people can be infected and infect others with covid. So what on earth is the point of vaccine passports other than to divide society + harm the economy? Scrap plan B

I am enjoying this debate on whether to take the vaccine or not. The points from each sides is quite educative. The intriguing one for me is the Natural immunity debate. Some are of view that we africans are building Natural immunity against covid hence no need for vaccine. 1/3

@NBSaphierMD Unfortunately ‚Äúnatural immunity‚Äù does not protect against Omicron. Hybrid immunity (that I call ‚Äúsuper immunity‚Äù) is the best protection.  If you have had COVID get at least one dose of vaccine and be protected. If you were vaccinated and get breakthrough COVID no need to boost.

@craigengler Why? You can still get covid! Mask don‚Äôt work! And the vaccine is causing medical issues that people didn‚Äôt previously have! Oh and the occurrence of new variants is caused by the vaccinated! It also has a 99.2% of survival! I have had covid was not to bad! Natural immunity!

@BarbMarley5 In reality the vaccine is useless. I know up to 5 people who took the vaccine and booster shot this year and still caught the covid. It should be a choice to take it and not to be forced on anyone. I wish I hadn‚Äôt taken it too. Plus you‚Äôre right there‚Äôs so many side effects.
